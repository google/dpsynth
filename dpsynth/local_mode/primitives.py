"""Differentially private primitives for local mode synthetic data generation.

This module is intended to be the singular home for low-level DP building blocks
in dpsynth, making a potential future switch to a PyDP or OpenDP backend
simpler.
While not all DP code in dpsynth currently goes through this module, that is the
long-term goal (at least for tabular data).

Design Decisions:

1) Pre-Computed Aggregates: All functions expect pre-computed aggregates
   (counts, histograms, quality scores) rather than performing data aggregation
   themselves. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure the
   appropriate privacy assumptions are satisfied (primarily that each user
   contributes at most one record to one bucket, or that user contributions are
   properly bounded via max_records_per_user).
2) Pure Functions: Primitives are pure functions that take NumPy inputs and
   return NumPy or Python outputs. State and DP accounting, when needed, are
   managed externally.

Privacy Characterizations:

- Exponential Mechanism (`exponential_mechanism`): Standard exponential
  mechanism for discrete selection given candidate quality scores.
- Quantiles (`quantiles_from_histogram`): Composition of exponential mechanisms
  via jittered recursive median bisection over a dense histogram.
- Gaussian Thresholding (`gaussian_thresholding`): Partition selection mechanism
  that adds Gaussian noise to counts and tests against a threshold bounding
  false positives for empty partitions at delta.
- Gaussian Mechanism (`gaussian_mechanism`): Standard Gaussian mechanism applied
  to input summary statistics (e.g., counts).

  """DP quantile edge indices into ``counts`` via jittered median bisection.

  Operates purely in index space: it returns cell indices into ``counts`` and
  leaves the mapping from index to domain value to the caller.

  Tie handling via jitter:
  Recursive median bisection needs each record assigned to one side of every
  split independently. A "spike" of records tied on one grid cell breaks this: a
  whole-cell split sends all that mass to one side, biasing the quantiles and
  collapsing sub-ranges (dropping edges). We fix this by breaking ties directly
  in the histogram domain rather than over the raw data values -- each cell's
  count is redistributed to nearby cells as Multinomial(count, kernel) (one
  draw per non-empty cell), which is distributionally identical to independently
  perturbing each record and so needs no extra privacy budget. The ``refine``
  strategy uses a strictly-positive kernel over refined sub-cells (value-
  preserving); the ``symmetric`` strategy uses a symmetric kernel over
  neighboring grid cells.

  Implements Algorithm 2 from the DP-SIPS paper (Swanberg et al., 2023) on

    1. Pre-filter partitions with true count below ``min_count``.
    2. Add Gaussian noise with standard deviation ``l2_sensitivity * sigma``.
    3. Return indices of partitions whose noisy count exceeds a threshold chosen
       to bound the false-positive probability per empty partition at ``delta``.

  A partition that is eligible here (count >= ``min_count``) but ineligible in a
  neighboring dataset (count <= ``min_count - 1``) can have true count at most
  ``min_count - 1 + linf_sensitivity``. Bounding the probability that such a
