"""Differentially private primitives for local mode synthetic data generation.

This module is intended to be the singular home for low-level DP building blocks
in dpsynth, making a potential future switch to a PyDP or OpenDP backend
simpler.
While not all DP code in dpsynth currently goes through this module, that is the
long-term goal (at least for tabular data).

Design Decisions:

1) Pre-Computed Aggregates: All functions expect pre-computed aggregates
   (counts, histograms, quality scores) rather than performing data aggregation
   themselves. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure the
   appropriate privacy assumptions are satisfied (primarily that each user
   contributes at most one record to one bucket, or that user contributions are
   properly bounded via max_records_per_user).
2) Pure Functions: Primitives are pure functions that take NumPy inputs and
   return NumPy or Python outputs. State and DP accounting, when needed, are
   managed externally.

Privacy Characterizations:

- Exponential Mechanism (`exponential_mechanism`): Standard exponential
  mechanism for discrete selection given candidate quality scores.
- Quantiles (`quantiles_from_histogram`): Composition of exponential mechanisms
  via jittered recursive median bisection over a dense histogram.
- Gaussian Thresholding (`select_partitions_gaussian_thresholding`): Partition
  selection mechanism that adds Gaussian noise to counts and tests against a
  threshold bounding false positives for empty partitions at delta.
- Gaussian Noise (`add_gaussian_noise`): Standard Gaussian mechanism applied to
  input summary statistics (e.g., counts).

  Operates purely in index space: it returns cell indices into ``counts`` and

  Tie handling via jitter:
  Recursive median bisection needs each record assigned to one side of every
  split independently. A "spike" of records tied on one grid cell breaks this: a
  whole-cell split sends all that mass to one side, biasing the quantiles and
  collapsing sub-ranges (dropping edges). We fix this by breaking ties directly
  in the histogram domain rather than over the raw data values -- each cell's
  count is redistributed to nearby cells as Multinomial(count, kernel) (one
  draw per non-empty cell), which is distributionally identical to independently
  perturbing each record and so needs no extra privacy budget. The ``refine``
  strategy uses a strictly-positive kernel over refined sub-cells (value-
  preserving); the ``symmetric`` strategy uses a symmetric kernel over
  neighboring grid cells.

  """Selects partitions using Gaussian Thresholding (Weighted Gaussian).

  This implements Algorithm 2 from the DP-SIPS paper (Swanberg et al., 2023)
  under item-level DP. It is the simplest partition selection mechanism:

    1. Compute the histogram of partition counts.
    2. Add Gaussian noise calibrated to the privacy budget.
    3. Return partitions whose noisy count exceeds a threshold chosen to
       bound the false-positive probability per empty partition at delta.

  Under item-level DP each record is treated as a distinct user contributing
  to exactly one partition, so the histogram has L2 sensitivity 1.  The
  threshold is T = min_count + sigma * Phi^{-1}(1 - delta), following the
  paper's formula with max_part = 1 and a shift of (min_count - 1) to
  account for the minimum count guarantee.

  When ``min_count > 1``, partitions with true count below ``min_count``
  are pre-filtered and the threshold shifts up accordingly. The privacy
  guarantee is preserved: partitions where both neighboring datasets are
  above ``min_count`` are covered by the Gaussian mechanism, and the
  boundary case (one dataset at ``min_count - 1``, the other at
  ``min_count``) is covered by the same additive delta.

  When ``max_records_per_user > 1`` the mechanism switches to user-level DP
  via a naive, conservative reduction: a single user may place all ``k``
  records in one partition, so the histogram's L2 sensitivity grows to ``k``.
  Both the noise standard deviation and the threshold are scaled by ``k``,
  which is equivalent to running the item-level mechanism with ``k`` times the
  sigma and threshold. This is sound but suboptimal -- a user->record mapping
  would allow tighter per-user contribution bounding (e.g. capping the number
  of distinct partitions a user touches) and hence far better utility.

  Args:
    rng: A numpy random number generator.
    data: 1D array of integers, where each element is a partition ID.
    gdp_budget: Privacy budget in terms of squared Gaussian DP mu parameter
      (gdp_budget = mu^2 = 1 / sigma^2).
    delta: Failure probability (false positive bound per empty partition).
    min_count: Minimum true count for a partition to be eligible. Partitions
      with fewer occurrences in the data are never returned. Must be >= 1.
    max_records_per_user: Assumed upper bound on the number of records a single
      user contributes. Added noise (and mechanism sensitivity) is scaled by
      this factor to provide user-level rather than record-level DP; the privacy
      accounting is unchanged. Soundness relies on the caller enforcing this
      bound.

  Returns:
    A tuple containing:
      - selected_partitions: 1D array of partition IDs that passed the
        threshold.
      - estimated_counts: 1D array of noisy counts for each selected
