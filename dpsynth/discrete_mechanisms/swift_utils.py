  """Finds the subset of candidates and budget allocation that maximizes score.

  Formal Problem Statement:
  Given a set of candidates C and a total budget B > 0, find a subset S ⊆ C
  and an allocation B_i for each i ∈ S such that:
      1. sum_{i ∈ S} B_i = B
      2. B_i > 0 for all i ∈ S

  The objective is to maximize the total score:
      Score = sum_{i ∈ S} [ w_i * (e_i - s_i * sqrt(2/pi) * B_i^(-0.5)) ]

  Optimization Logic:
  For any fixed subset S, the optimal budget allocation is:
      B_i = B * (y_i / sum_{j ∈ S} y_j)
  where y_i = (w_i * s_i * sqrt(2/pi))^(2/3).

  This reduces the problem to selecting a subset S that maximizes:
      Objective = sum_{i ∈ S} (w_i * e_i) - (sum_{i ∈ S} y_i)^1.5 / sqrt(B)

  Args:
      candidates: A list of Candidate objects.
      budget: The total fixed budget B to be distributed. Can be interpreted as
        either a GDP or RDP budget.

  Returns:
      A dictionary mapping candidate IDs to their optimally allocated budget.
      Candidates not included in the subset are omitted.
