"""Implementations of mechanisms that operate over discrete data.

Note: This mechanism is not intended to be called directly. It should typically
be used within `DiscreteSynthesizer` or `TabularSynthesizer`. Users who call it
directly will miss out on features like 1-way measurement selection and domain
compression.
